# Integration Test: Flag Creation with Tags

This integration test verifies that flag creation correctly includes tags in the API response after the bug fix.

## Problem Solved

Previously, when creating flags (AB experiments and latches), the tags were being associated correctly in the database but were **not included in the API response**. This caused issues where:

- AB experiments didn't show the "AB" tag in the creation response
- Latches didn't show the "latch" tag in the creation response
- Frontend applications couldn't immediately see the associated tags

## Test Coverage

The integration test covers three scenarios:

### 1. AB Experiment Flag Creation
- Creates a basic AB experiment flag
- Verifies "AB" tag is included in response
- Checks default flag properties

### 2. AB Experiment with Template
- Creates an AB experiment using `simple_boolean_flag` template
- Verifies "AB" tag is included in response
- Verifies template-created segments and variants are included
- Checks that the "on" variant is created

### 3. Latch Creation
- Creates a latch flag
- Verifies "latch" tag is included in response
- Verifies latch-created segments and variants are included
- Checks that the "APPLICABLE" variant is created

## How to Run

```bash
# Run the integration test
go run integration_test_flag_creation_tags.go
```

## Expected Output

```

```

## Technical Details

The fix involved modifying the `mapResponseAndSaveFlagSnapShot` function in `pkg/handler/crud_flag_creation.go` to reload the flag with all relationships (segments, variants, tags) before mapping it to the API response.

**Before (Broken):**
```go
payload, err := e2rMapFlag(f)  // f.Tags is empty - not preloaded
```

**After (Fixed):**
```go
// Reload the flag with all relationships
if err := entity.PreloadSegmentsVariantsTags(getDB()).First(f, f.ID).Error; err != nil {
    // handle error
}
payload, err := e2rMapFlag(f)  // f.Tags now populated
```

This ensures that the API response includes all the associated data that was created during the flag creation process.

## Files Modified

- `pkg/handler/crud_flag_creation.go` - Fixed the response mapping
- `pkg/handler/crud_test.go` - Added unit tests
- `integration_test_flag_creation_tags.go` - This integration test

## Related Issues

This fix resolves the issue where flag creation responses were inconsistent with other flag operations that properly include all relationships in their responses.
